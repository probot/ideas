Share ideas for new GitHub Apps

---

One of the best ways to improve your skillset is to build new things, and often people have great ideas but no way to build on them. This repository (and it's issues) is a way for people to share new ideas for GitHub Apps in an open way. To receive feedback, build on ideas collaboratively and get help when needed.

Please, share your ideas! We'd all love to hear them!
Existing ideas can be found [here](https://github.com/probot/ideas/blob/master/GOOGLE_SUMMER_OF_CODE.md)
