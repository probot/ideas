# Probot Ideas

Hello! This is a place to share ideas for new GitHub Apps built with [Probot](https://probot.github.io/).

---

One of the best ways to improve your skillset is to build new things, and often people have great ideas but no way to build on them.

This repository (and it's issues) is a way for:
- **sharing** your ideas for GitHub Apps in an open way -- hearing feedback, working together, and getting help :muscle:
- **discovering** others' ideas for bots to create -- you are welcome to build on any idea here, knowing there are already users excited for your app's existence :boom:

Please, share your ideas! We'd all love to hear them!
